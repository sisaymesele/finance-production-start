                        <p class="mt-2 text-muted">The system starts by capturing company and employee financial data,
                            including earnings and deductions.
                            Users select a payroll month and define payroll components, then initiate payroll processing
                            for that period.
                            Adjustments can be made for errors or updates—such as missing earnings or incorrect
                            deductions—by linking original and current payroll periods.
                            The system calculates gross pay, tax, pension, and net pay automatically and updates
                            adjusted and recorded values accordingly.
                            Reports, journal entries, and expense summaries are generated to ensure accuracy,
                            transparency, and traceability.</p>

                            Payroll adjustments are used when an error or update is discovered after the original
